Virtual environment is a version control system which seperates from each environment

Setting Up Virtual Environment
Created the Virtual Environment in Visual Studio Code using the terminal with the following command line:Python3 -m venv {EnvironmentName}.
Activate the environment using the following command: {EnvironmentName}/Scripts/activate. This activates the environment which means that you are currently using the version of the environment you just activated.
Then make sure to have the following librarys:
  pip install opencv-python
  pip install tensorflow
  pip install ipykernel
Environment is now set up! It is ready to be used.

Firstly, I created a new python file named it 'Test.py' this file is used to test to see if the keras model has set up correctly and working using the Keras Model.
